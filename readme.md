# Vintage Apple Mac stuff

Lists of what I have for sale or giveaway. From the 80s onwards, mostly 90s. I’m not a collector or a hoarder, I just don’t throw Apple stuff away. Instead I store it carefully away from heat, sunlight, etc. In the U.K. but can consider shipping some smaller items—can’t face the risk of packing desktops or monitors though.

Now, I just want them to go to a good home.

No idea what to charge for these, some probably free to collect, a few scarce or unusual items for offers or to work out a value.

A couple of the machines run older exhibited versions of my digital art software [cubeLife](https://cubelife.org), so I might want to keep those (PowerPC 8500/150, Power Mac G4, white iMac). Might also want to hang on to the Powerbook 100, because it was my first laptop (but needs a recap, which I’d like someone more experienced to do).
