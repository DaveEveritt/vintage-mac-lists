# Vintage Apple Mac stuff

Apple Mac items for sale or donation from the 80s onwards, mostly 90s. I’m not a collector or hoarder, just can’t face throwing Apple stuff away. I store it carefully away from temperature extremes and sunlight, etc. I’m in the U.K. but can ship smaller items—can’t face the risk of packing desktops or monitors though.

No idea what to ask for many items, some possibly free to collect, a few scarce/unusual items for offers or to work out a value.

Some machines were used to run exhibited versions of my digital art software [cubeLife](https://cubelife.org) so I might want to keep them (PowerPC 8500/150, Power Mac G4, white iMac). Also, might or might not want to keep the Powerbook 100 (my first laptop, but needs a recap which I’d like someone more experienced to do).
